# Past-Projects

Thank you for showing interest in my personal code repository!

This repo contains selected data project files from econometrics coursework, 
and selected data files I solely authored as part of my Research Assistant responsibilites. 
There are many other .do files and python files I wish I could post here, but 
many of them contain contributions from other authors, whose excellent work I 
won't claim credit for.

questions?

Thanks so much!

Owen
